SWBinaryButton
==============

A binary button animation UI implemented on iOS.

Simply simulate the button UI from the iOS app "WE HEART PICS" -> [on AppStore](https://itunes.apple.com/en/app/we-heart-pics/id488515478?mt=8)

## How to use

Download the demo project, import the two files below in your Xcode project:

- SWBinaryButton.h
- SWBinaryButton.m

Use it like the demo project did. Create the instance of SWBinaryButton(UIView based) with two UIButton initialized, then add the SWBinaryButton view as a subview to wherever you want.

Feel free to contact me if you have any question or suggestion.

Thank you.
